Student: Ryan Sands

My contribution to this project was namely within the menu.py file and main.py files.
 
My roles and responsibilites can be summarised as follows:

	- Creating the main menu screen and coding this in menu.py

	- Creating the pause screen and coding this in menu.py

	- Creating character avatar artwork, as well as background art

	- Contributing to initial main.py through:

		- Character movement (jumping and left/right) methods
		- Sourcing and adding background music
		- Adding jumping sound affects

In addition, I assisted team members in the creation of other main.py properties, such as 
refining code comments, variable names and optimising general code structure.
